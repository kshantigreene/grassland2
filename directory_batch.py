#James:
#The data will have a root directory containing a directory for each sensor
#Within those directories will a directory for each day containing the files for each day (each file is about an hour of recording)
#The results should be:
#For each sensor, for each day: a sum amplitude for that day You can store this in a 2D array or a hashmap (sensor: hashmap(day:sum_amplitude))

#for now, to find the sum amplitude, just assume the amplitude of each file is 1.0. 
#for each sample, multiply amplitude * the confidence of the sample. Sum all the samples for a day directory together to get the total sum
#later we will figure out how to get the actual amplitude (I have a way using my own analysis, but it doesn't use birdnet)
